General hint regarding opsi Package Builder
===========================================

This repository is work in progress. There are many things that won't work at the moment and will change over time. so don't use this in production.

I take no responsibility for your decision to use anything from here!!!

opsi PackageBuilder is only tested with Python 3.4 and PyQT5.


Requirements
============
PyQt5
spur
sphinx_rtd_theme
Crypto.Cipher
simple-crypt>=4.0.0


Included Scripts
================

(The scripts will only work under Windows!)

	- 1_update_locale.cmd: 		Re-scan source files for new(updated language strings.

	- 2_compile_resource.cmd:	Make Python file from *.qrc file

	- 3_sphinx.cmd:			Re-scan source file in-place documentation

	- 4_distrib.cmd:		Build install package via PyInstaller (NOT REALLY WORKING AT THE MOMETN)


Compiling MapDrive.dll
======================

You need to install VC++ 2010 Express and if you want to compile for a 64Bit Platform, Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1 additionally.


Using PyInstaller
=================

``Please customize the path to your project in opsipackagebuiler.spec!``

You need to download a Python 3 compatible version of PyInstaller from www.pyinstaller.org and install it from the source package. Before you do that, modify the file:

*pyinstaller-python3/PyInstaller/utils/hooks/hookutils.py*

according to this:

.. code-block:: html

	def qt5_qml_dir():
	    try:
	        qmldir = compat.exec_command("qmake", "-query", "QT_INSTALL_QML")
	        qmldir = qmldir.strip()
	    except IOError:
	        qmldir = ''
	    if len(qmldir) == 0:
		....

Reason:
The command "qmake -query QT_INSTALL_QML" returns the path to the qml folder, but has carriage return ("\r\n") at the end of the string under windows. This can't be handled correctly, so remove it.
